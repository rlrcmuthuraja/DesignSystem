## Logos in the header
If you'd like to use a custom logo, please make sure it is an image that has a
transparent background. This will look better agains the dark header.

In [this example](/components/detail/header--custom-logotype) we clearly see that
the logofile is an opaquq image with white background. It looks suboptimal on the
dark header.

Instead use a 24-bit PNG format or SVG. Transparent GIFs may also work, but since
the maximum number of colors in this filetype, be sure to export it against a matte
color that matches the header background (`#1a293e`).

As an alternative, if you don't have a high quality logotype, you can use a
logomark instead. Combine the [logomark with a text-based title](/components/detail/header--custom-logomark).
