## Modern browser testing

In modern web design, we have accepted that the user will access our
products using a plethora of devices and user-agents. In such a
perspective, we also accept that the user experience will be different
based on the user's context.

<blockquote>
    <p>While some designers strive for cross-browser pixel perfection,
    proponents of fluid design do not think that layouts have to look
    identical across all platforms and screen resolutions.

## Supported Browsers
We divide browsers into three categories: A-grade, B-grade, and C-grade
browsers.

- **A-grade**: These browsers should be actively tested on. Minor visual
differences may occur, but that is ok. Reported bugs _will be considered
fixed_.
- **B-grade**: Though not actively tested on, these browsers should work fine,
and bugs _will be considered fixed_ when reported. Visual differences may
occur, but that is usually ok.
- **C-grade**: Core functional support only. However, any issues that
cause functional issues _may be considered fixed_, such as an issue that
hides or makes it impossible to click a call to action button. Visual
differences will most likely occur, but that is usually ok.
