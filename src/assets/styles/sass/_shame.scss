// Shameful code
// ==========================================================================
//
// We all know that, no matter how hard we may try, sometimes we do need to use
// quick fixes, hacks and questionable techniques in our code. It happens, whether
// we like to admit it or not.
//
// The real problem, though, is that we rarely go back and tidy these things up.
// They slip through the cracks, get ignored, go unnoticed, and stay for good.
// This we do not have to do.
//
// The idea of shame.scss is that you have a totally new file reserved just for
// your hacky code. The code you have to write to get the release out on time,
// but the code that makes you ashamed.
//
// 1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in shame.scss.
// 2. Document all hacks fully:
//    A. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
//    B. Why was this needed?
//    C. How does this fix it?
//    D. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
// 3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then
//    their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
// 4. Try and clean shame.scss up when you have some down time.
//    A. Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual
//       sprint time to it.
